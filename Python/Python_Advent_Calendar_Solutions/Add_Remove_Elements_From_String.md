# Day 8 - Add (+) and Remove (-) Elements from a List of Strings

## Prompt

Write a function called `manage_participants(participants_list, to_remove_list, to_add_list)` that takes as input a list of participants (list of strings), a list of names to be removed from the list and a list of names to be added to the list. If either `to_remove_list` or `to_add_list` are not empty, this function should remove/add all elements specified there from the participants_list. Please make sure that you check if a person is in the `participants_list` before trying to remove her/him. The function should return a sorted, modified `participants_list` list.

If you are a beginner, assume that if a person with the same name already exists in the participants list, you just skip/don't add her/him again.

If you are not a beginner, handle duplicate names in the following way: if i.e. 'John' already exists in the `participants_list` and another 'John' should be added, change the name of the 'John' from the `participants_list` to 'John_1' and the name of 'John' added from the `to_add_list` list to 'John_2'.
