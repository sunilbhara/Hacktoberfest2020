# Day 9 - Return a Sorted List of Tuples

## Prompt

Write a function called `choose_destination(list_of_tuples)` that takes as input a list of tuples in form `(string, boolean)`, i.e. `list_of_tuples=[('Warsaw', False), ('Barcelona', True)]`, where each tuple represents a city and if this city is a good destination for me to go, and returns a sorted list of potential places where I could go. If you are advanced, write a 1-line-solution here :)
